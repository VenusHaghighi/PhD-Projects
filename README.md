PhD-Projects Repository is a collection of coding projects developed during my PhD research. Each project corresponds to a distinct research challenge, covering advanced methods in graph-based fraud detection in the face of camouflage. The repository serves as both a record of my experimental work and a resource for researchers interested in tackling similar challenges.

1) MAGNET is designed to address the challenge of camouflaged fraudulent behaviors in multi-relational graphs. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all neighbors equally, MAGNET introduces an adaptive aggregation mechanism that discriminates between informative and misleading neighbors. This framework demonstrates strong resilience against adversarial camouflage, making it particularly effective in complex fraud detection scenarios.

2) DEFEND (Discriminative Enhanced Aggregation Graph Neural Network-based Fraud Detection Model) introduces an edge discriminating module to separate homophily and heterophily neighborhoods, a camouflage-aware dual-channel aggregator to capture multi-frequency information, and inter-relation correlation modeling to integrate cross-relation behavior patterns. By combining these modules into a unified framework, DEFEND generates more powerful and discriminative node representations, significantly improving fraud detection performance in multi-relational fraud graphs

3) TROPICAL (Transformer-based hYpergrapH learnIng for CAmoufLage-aware fraud detection) focuses on capturing high-order structural dependencies in fraud graphs that are often overlooked by pairwise methods. TROPICAL encodes complex group-based interactions, enabling the detection of camoufalged fraud behaviors. The model integrates attention mechanisms to adaptively weigh hyperedges, uncovering critical patterns that indicate fraud.

4) LGL-FRAUD is a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enable training-free fraud detection through prompt-based reasoning. The framework employs BWGNN to generate discriminative embeddings that capture structural and behavioral node patterns, which are then translated into natural language prompts. These structured prompts are processed by pre-trained LLMs to perform fraud prediction in zero-shot and few-shot settings, without the need for fine-tuning.
